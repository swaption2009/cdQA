Intro,"Analytics is something every business requires to stay competitive. The more information you can use to inform your actions, the better. Analytics and the techniques to properly use them support both strategic marketing decisions such as how much to spend or what a customer is worth, and more tactical campaign decisions, such as targeting the right customer with the right message at the right time. No matter what industry you're business is in, it's important to understand the information surrounding your market, your competition, and the journey your customers take. Marketing analytics benefits your entire organization and it's one of the most fundamental skills any marketer or business owner must hone. Now, I'm sure you're aware there's a lot of data available to us. So it's important that we really measure what matters. We have to go beyond getting those metrics, we must sort out how to take action with that data. We're going to spend a lot of time together talking about analytics, so let's talk about our goals for what we're studying. We want to learn how this data is collected and distributed. Knowing where data comes from and how it's combined will help you understand how that data can be leveraged. You'll need to know where to look for this data, and then you'll be more sensitive around the concerns of how data is collected. We also want to understand the questions that we're trying to answer. Every business is trying to get the right message to the right users at the right time. Your message and your timing and your users are well different than mine. So you'll have to be specific with the questions that you want to answer for your business goals. We also want to understand the available metrics and how they're measured. In each channel, paid earned, and owned, you'll have different metrics, and you need to know which are the most important. You also want to understand how they're used so that way, you can figure out how to combine them to get better insights. We also want to figure out how to watch out for data reporting pitfalls so we don't fall victim to common mistakes. Next, we need to figure out what metrics are important for your business goals. You have all of this data coming in, but what data is actually important and actionable for your business. You need to be able to understand what data you're going to use to get you from point a to point b. From here, we want to understand how to apply these metrics to your business. Everything that we do in marketing analytics is about being actionable. We want to understand the information and create reports that can be used to drive real decisions. It's also important that we have confidence in reporting so that we can take action on our analytics measurements and on the reporting we make. All kinds of decisions get made on this data and you're going to want the confidence that you've found the right information, use it in the right way, and made the right decisions. As you come to learn the foundations of marketing analytics, you'll be better equipped to gather, analyze, and report on the data you need to make better decisions."
Ecosystem,"When we look at the marketing ecosystem, today's marketer has access to a staggering amount of data, and the challenge is that you're expected to be able to capture, analyze, and report on all of this data, and it can be overwhelming. A common graphic that gets passed around in the industry is this landscape diagram from Chiefmartech.com. Updated in 2018, this super graphic displays over 6,800 different marketing technology solutions, every new platform, tool, and data vendor contributes to a digital ecosystem that is beyond mind-boggling. Now, when we think about marketing analytics, we often start with the tool that we're most familiar with, and then we look at the world of analytics through that lens. For many of us, that might be Google Analytics. It's arguably the most popular marketing analytics platform, but Google Analytics provides us one view. It's primarily looking at our website metrics. We're seeing things such as how much time people spend on our website, what pages they look at, and whether they buy or abandon our site. But Google Analytics can't answer every question, and as you saw, there's clearly enough data solutions out there to answer just about any question we may have. So when it comes to analytics, we have this giant ecosystem by which we can pull all of our insights out of, but we don't necessarily need all of these tools. In fact, we likely only need a fraction of them. You see this entire ecosystem gives us access to specific answers based on our needs. We can find the one tool that answers the question that we have. For example, we might use a tool to generate heat maps based on user behavior on our website, and then we'll capture data from that, or we might be running ads on a different platform such as AdWords, Twitter, or maybe Facebook, and there we can also capture data. We may also use a tool to evaluate call volumes at our call center or maybe a tool specific to measuring keyword ranking in our search results. Now, all of this data is native to that platform. So each platform is doing a very specific job and capturing a very specific set of data. Now, what we can do is we can go to each tool and look at that data and perhaps we can pull it down manually just like we would do in Google Analytics. We could load this data up into various spreadsheets and combine it, but the ecosystem also gives us access to software that automatically aggregates all of that data. So we can plug in data from each of these tools and use one platform to look at all of that data in combination. This can make our life easier. So we can use this software to combine our data with other people's data to get really rich insights on our metrics. Like we mentioned earlier, most of that data is only going to come from a handful of sources and these sources make up part of what we call our marketing technology stack or MarTech for short. Now, the technology that you're going to use will typically align to the various parts of the marketing funnel, and much about what we talked in analytics really refers back to this marketing funnel. If you remember, the marketing funnel goes Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action, and Advocacy. So some tools cover a lot of the funnel. Google Analytics is a great example. It can display data surrounding traffic arriving at the site, top of the funnel, then engaging on the site, and then converting on the site there at the bottom of that funnel. Now, some tools are specific to various areas of the funnel. With awareness, you might be capturing data out of platforms like AdWords, Facebook, or SEMRush. With an interest and desire, you might have data coming from WordPress, HubSpot, or Mailchimp. For action, well, you might be leveraging Salesforce, Optimizely, or Shopify, and then within advocacy, well, you might have your own data from your CRM. What you use is really going to depend on what your business goals are within each area of the funnel. So as you can see, we have all of these sources, and then we have all of these areas of the customer journey that we want to capture data for. So we're faced with two challenges. The first is, where should our data come from? The second is, how do I use that data? Well, there is no one size fits all approach. You don't really start by picking your data sources. You actually start by picking your strategy. So we can answer that first question of where the data comes from, by figuring out our objectives. What does our business do? What information helps us do it better? Really, we're trying to figure out what happens at each stage of our customer journey, and then we need to figure out how to measure that so that we can make more informed decisions. Now, when it comes time to apply the data, we have to think about the action that we want to take. You see, we collect and use data to inform decisions. So we really need to think about the question we're trying to answer or the decision we want to make, and then work from there. So as you can see, the way that you can use this ecosystem, can be figured out either top down or bottom up. Either start with your objective, and then pinpoint all the data that you'll collect across the funnel or start with the question you want to answer, and figure out what data you need to get that answer."
Data Collection,"Now, the ecosystem of data is no doubt impressive. So finding and using this information will become easier, if you understand how the data collection process works. Now, I'm sure it's no surprise to you that every action you take on the web is tracked one way or another. The pages you view, the files you download, and even your demographic and interest data, is all recorded. At the 2018, Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Intel projected that by 2020, we will be generating 1.5 gigabytes of data per day from our individual Internet activities. All of that tracking data we bought and sold by over 4,000 data brokers in the United States alone. Now, this data is collected as first, second, and third party data. First party data is what you collect, all the information that you immediately have access to, information coming from your website, your subscriptions, and your CRM. Now, second party data is essentially all of the first party data that is resold. So if you collected data on your customers and sold that to someone else, it would then become second party data. This could include things such as your website data, but it also goes as far as how people are using an application or even surveys that you run. Finally, third party data. These are all the aggregators. Third-party data vendors by from all sorts of sources and then they combine this data. Now, this data is coming from a myriad of places. First, we have the cookies that follow you around or pixels that fire when you make a transaction, and then we also have device fingerprinting, which is a really interesting method of combining information about you, such as your location, screen size, the hardware using, plugins you have, apps you have, software, and so on. Because it's easy to guess whether or not you're the same person between two sessions on a site, even if you leave your phone to your computer, because it's very unlikely that somebody else has that exact combination of items on their device. In fact, your very own Internet service provider could be selling data about who you are, where you've been, and so on. So what can we do with this knowledge? Well, we know that we can layer in all of these additional insights into this traditionally flat information. If you find a gap in your data and you want to fill it in to answer a question, you now understand that this information is out there and you can find it and fill that it take Google Analytics, for example. Let's say I measure one visit to my website. Now, that data point is interesting, but there is a breadth of information behind it. Google can tell me characteristics such as where that clip came from, how long that visit lasted, and the page that they were on. Now, that's all first party information, but dig deeper and you'll find that Google can bring me third party information, such as the visitor's interests, their market segment, even their age range and gender. That data combined helps paint a much better picture of what's going on on my website. It tells me more about the type of people that are being exposed to my content, and it can help me understand how to change my marketing behaviors. So as we layer that data together, we can answer more complex questions and segment in ways that provide us richer insight."
Layering in Data,"One of my first jobs out of high school was working for a grocery store. It was a really interesting job. I got to meet a lot of people, and I also got to observe all of the interesting ways that a grocery store works. Now, picture grocery store with me. You walk in, and the store is stocked, you'll have everything from vegetables, all the way to canned goods, and there are all of these different products. Followed behind that, you have people that come into the store, and every person is going to have different behaviors. Some are coming in for one specific item, others are coming in and they're browsing the store. Now, at the end of that browsing period, the customer is going to come check out, they're going to pay for whatever they've bought, and they're going to leave. Now, imagine trying to grow this grocery store without any data. We couldn't, we'd have no idea what to put on the shelf, or how much we can pay our employees, or whether we were making any money at all. So think about owning a grocery store. What data would we want to collect? Well, if we take a top-down approach, let's think about our objectives. Primarily, we need to sell groceries, and we need to be profitable. So if we need to be profitable, then we need to make sure that we're capturing data on sales, and we also need to have data on how much we're spending, and how much we're making money. If we need to sell groceries, then we need to keep track of what products we're moving. Now, from a bottom-up approach, we could ask this a different way. What if instead we wanted to answer the question, what are the most popular hours at my grocery store? Well, what data do you think we would need to answer this question? Well, I would need to measure how many people come to the store each hour. But here's the tricky part. How do we quantify what we mean by popular? Is the store popular because there are lots of people in it for that hour? Or is the store popular because we make the most money in that hour? Well, that's going to depend on your business objectives. If you opened up a brand new grocery store, you might be focusing on awareness, you simply want foot traffic. Therefore, you might want to measure how many people are coming through the store more than you care about whether you're making money yet. Now, a more mature grocery store might be concerned about making money during a certain period of time, and therefore, popularity would be a measurement of revenue during that timeframe. Now, the point of this thought experience is to get you to start thinking about all of the nuances in the marketing analytics process. We need to know what questions we want to answer, and then we need to know how we will qualify that that's the answer we want. From there, we can figure out the right data to combine. When it comes to answering questions, we're always combining data. Let's think about a few more questions we can ask in regards to our grocery store. Some will be easy to qualify. What isn't selling? So we can simply measure what products sold and which products didn't, there isn't a lot of data to combine there. What about how many repeat customers do we get? So that's a measurement of loyalty, although we're simply asking how many times a customer comes during a period of time. How about where is most of our profit coming from? Probably easy to qualify as well, maybe do we ever run out of stock, if so, on what or how much money would we lose on a particular day? But some questions are harder to qualify. Take this one. Are customers loyal? Well, what does loyalty mean? Is loyalty a measurement of how much money someone spends? Is loyalty a measurement of how many times they visit? Is loyalty a measure of how many times they visit in a period of time? Is it three times a week or three times a year? That's for you to decide. Another really tough question to qualify, is the store laid out in a good manner? Well, that's another tough one, because we have to combine all sorts of data. Is the store laid out in a good manner depends on our goals. Are we trying to sell a particular product? Perhaps we're pushing a new product, therefore we might decide that it needs to be on an end cap, and we decide that if it sells more than if it was in a row, then yes, the store was laid out better than if it was put somewhere else. There are all sorts of metrics that have to be layered into that. Ultimately, what we're trying to accomplish is becoming aware of how we have to frame our mindset. Every time we think of questions to answer, we must also be aware of how we're qualifying whether we've arrived at the right answer."
Analytics Process,"In the world of business and in marketing, we often talk a lot about processes. We do this because processes help us work efficiently and effectively. They're also a great foundation when you're starting out because it gives you something to work through. It helps you practice and repeat these behaviors that then allow you to understand why you're doing certain things. Whatever we're trying to do with our data, the process is always the same. Measure, analyze, and improve. The first step is to measure. Now, we know that we have all of this data to pick from. Now, it's actually relatively cheap and easy to simply collect all of the data you can. However, that can cause some problems. First of all, simply collecting all of the data you can could create a problem by which you're just chasing after all of these sources. Remember, you simply want to be using the tools that matter and then let those tools collect all the data that they can. When it comes time to use that data though, it's important to be selective. Otherwise, it'll be like drinking from a fire hose. When it comes to measure, we're going to focus on these objectives. Remember, we take our objectives. We look through that lens to determine what we're measuring. Now, once we've measured all of this data and we've collected these metrics, it's time to analyze it. So we take the data, we inspect it, and we start developing insights that allow us to take action. Analyzing data is similar to being a detective. Now, we're going to talk a lot about analyzing data later on and we'll really go into depth about how to think through your analysis. After we've done the analyzing, we improve. Everything that we do has to be actionable, you're going to hear me repeat this often. You need to figure out what you're really doing with this data. Simply collecting it and looking at it isn't good enough and then reporting on it still isn't good enough. You need to make sure that the information that you're sharing has action behind it. What is the goal of looking at this information? What decision are you going to make based off of it? From there, you simply repeat this process. Every time you take on a new initiative, whenever you start a new marketing campaign, think first about what needs to be measured, then analyze it, and then improve it. As we spend more time together digging into real-world scenarios, always pay attention to the steps we take. Regardless of the project, we're always going to measure, analyze, and improve"
Analyzing Metrics,"Let's talk about analyzing metrics. Earlier, we touched on one component of our analytics process and that was analyzing, but we've only scratched the surface. When it comes to analyzing data, it's actually a fairly deep concept and there's a true methodology by which we want to look at these insights. Now the skill of drawing information out of our datasets is often going to be the result of experience. As you spend more time with the data, you'll get more comfortable at finding connections between all of these different data points. But simply being curious, having an outside the box way of thinking, and figuring out how to see the bigger picture is a great place to start. Analyzing the marketing metrics tells us what is happening but only if we do our analysis properly. Now it's just as likely you'll do a bad analysis on good data as it is you'll do a fantastic analysis on bad or suspect data. It's actually rarely the case that the data itself is bad, but rather the way the data is interpreted. For example, it's easy to mix up a visit and a pageview. A visit is one person arriving whereas a pageview is something that happens every time a page loads. A visitor can have many pageviews. Think about a visitor to our grocery store. They come in and they could look at many products, but that one person has looked at many things. If we instead accidentally modeled our conversion rate on how many products were looked at versus how many people purchased, we'd have a really unrealistic view of what's happening. So the metrics that you use need to be accurate. You need to be using the right data and the right data points. Also, in our analysis process, all of these metrics must be compared. So we start with them being accurate, and then we think about how we compare them. Comparison is important because without it, the metrics will really provide no sense of direction. So in order to generate a comparison, we look at change and context over time. In other words, how does this metric change during a period of time and what is the context of that change? Is it normal or abnormal? So I want to give you an example. Let's say that we open up our store and there are no visitors. The first thing that we have to do is compare that. So if you look to yesterday, is zero less than yesterday or more than yesterday for that same window of time? If we opened up the story yesterday and we had three visitors and today we have zero, well, now we know that the change is we have three less visitors during this same time period. Now we have to ask is that normal or abnormal? To do that, we might have to zoom out. We might need to look at a trend over time. Do we typically have a lot of visitors in the morning? Is today different from other days? Perhaps today is a Saturday and most people aren't coming in this early on a Saturday. So we have to look at the context, we have to zoom out to really understand whether that change is normal or abnormal. Analyzing the data is an exercise that's oftentimes like being a detective. So remember, when you analyze your metrics, you always want to start with accurate metrics. From there, you need to compare them. You have to look at change and context."
Questions,"We've established that the marketing landscape is complex. We have data being collected and delivered through a vast ecosystem of platform. We can combine this data layering it and segmenting it to answer our key questions. Additionally, we have a process by which we can look at the analytics, and we even have a methodology by how we analyze these insights. Now, we're always looking to capture the right data based on our objectives and figuring out the insights that we specifically need to get out of this data. But when it comes time to actually start pulling these metrics, it can be confusing to know how much data you need to answer your question. So I encourage you to approach every analytics project so that you can answer these five questions. First, what happened? Are we looking at a data point or multiple data points. We're usually looking at this data in comparison to something. So oftentimes, we'll see that the trend is up or a trend is down, and that'll indicate that something has happened. Then we need to ask ourselves, are these results good? Now we talked a little about how we evaluate this, change and context help us understand if this is normal or abnormal. Once we've identified that, we need to understand why did it happen, and this is where it gets really complex. Now we're being a detective. There are many ways that can contribute to why something happened. Lots of data to discover, to figure out what went wrong or what went right. It's also important that we be careful between causation and correlation because oftentimes we can compare the wrong data or the right data and get drastically different answers. Next, we need to figure out what's happening now. Right, we want to figure out if this trend is continuing or if this event happened one time or if it's going to keep happening. Finally, what will happen in the future. Remember, we're always thinking about actionability. So what's going to happen if we don't change things or what will happen if we change things. Again, some things are going to be one time occurrences. Other events might be the start of growth or decline. Now, when we think about the future, we can start forecasting by manipulating the data. Let's think about this a different way. Say you're asked to review the sales performance of your e-commerce store from last Friday. So what happened? Let's say we had 30 sales. Okay. Are these results good? Well, we need to figure out if this particular measurement is good or bad, which means we have to compare it. So we'll use that historical dataset or even benchmarks that already exist to determine whether what we have is good or bad. Again, I like to use the change and contexts within that select time period. So let's say we look at change. We identify that this is a 50 percent lift from last Friday. What's the context then, is this normal or abnormal? Well, we have to think about this. It could be good or it could be bad. Is there seasonality involved? Let's say today is a holiday. So a 50 percent lift from last Friday can actually be bad if we should have expected 150 percent lift. So now we need to figure out why it happened. Let's say it ends up being a good thing. Are we running a promotion? Is that promotion what contributed, or did more traffic come to the site? Was there a blog mentioned somewhere on the web? You have to connect all the dots. We need to identify where this lift came from because that will help us figure out later what we do when we forecast into the future. So what's happening right now? Well, we look at this and we say sales are still up, and relative to what we typically see. By knowing that what's happening now follows a positive trend, we're less concerned than if it was following a negative trend. Finally, what might happen in the future. Well now, we can start to understand if we expect this pattern to continue or not. If it was seasonality, then we know that this is going to drop off. If it was a new marketing promotion, then we might think, well, if we keep investing this spend, then we should keep getting these results. Now you can plug that data in and start asking great questions. If we keep spending this much money, are we going to keep getting this return, and if so, what does that mean for our bottom line? Can we spend more money and create more revenue. In which case, you start to get into forecasting and projecting, and now you start thinking about how you can build actionable insights. Now we can take action. We can say, well, we're going to forecast, and now we start thinking about hypotheses and testing, which we'll get into later."
Business Goals,"As we continue to lay the groundwork for our marketing analytics, I want to revisit the topic of setting our business objectives. I think it's important that we go a little deeper into what makes up our goals. Now, you might also hear these interchangeably referred to as business goals or marketing goals, and these are terms that all mean the same thing. Now your business objectives are the measurable targets of what you want to achieve, and all business objectives should follow the SMART goal format. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. As a grocery store, I might say that my objective is to sell as much product as I can at the highest profit margin that I can. But that's actually a very broad view. We need to really frame this objective in the context of SMART. Instead, we'd be better off saying, generate $50,000 in revenue for the month of March. It's specific because we're sticking to just revenue, we're not layering in other pieces. It's measurable because there is a metric there, $50,000. Now it's achievable, and this is all based on how realistic this will be for your business. Stretched goals are great but if the store is only doing $10,000 a month on average, asking for a $40,000 improvement in one month might not really be achievable. In this case, we'll assume that it is achievable. Now it's relevant and it's time-bound because we're measuring it in the context of one quarter. Now this is a pretty broad objective. So you might actually take this and break it down into individual initiatives that help you realize that goal. Now oftentimes, we break these objectives into key performance indicators, and we'll talk more on that later. But ultimately, let's say for the grocery store that one of these smaller items is going to be boosting sales of soda, which is a high-margin product. Or perhaps, in order to achieve that 50,000 revenue goal, we really need to increase the efficiency of our ads, which will save us money, but try to still bring in that same amount of revenue. As you look at your analytics project, be sure you're working off SMART goals.
"
Frameworks,"Realistically we can make data tell any story that we want and you can twist the metrics to make anything sound like a win. This is why it's really important that what you measure and report on is meaningful and that you're working on a shared vision for what you're trying to achieve. By staying on a shared vision, you'll avoid the mistake of crafting a narrative that isn't true to what you're actually working towards. Now as you're coming to see, we continue to keep layering concepts together. We talked about creating smart objectives but it's time to start putting all of these layers together using a measurement framework. A measurement framework builds from the metrics up to your objectives. This is helpful, as you begin to work together with other teams or even within your own team, you can coordinate across all of the channels, platforms, and initiatives that are underway. Additionally, if you go to work for a large company in a marketing department, you'll likely be introduced to an existing framework. Companies use all sorts of frameworks to stay unified. Some companies are going to use smart objectives, others might use OKRs, which stand for Objective Key Results, and others might use a laddering framework that combines objectives with KPIs, which stands for Key Performance Indicators. Now, what's important is that you're aware that there is no one single framework but you really should be familiar that they exist and how to use them. Now, realistically, frameworks are just a helpful way of visualizing and making sense of data. As you sit down and start out in the marketing analytics process, you'll likely want to draft frameworks that help you. But as you go about your day and day, you're not really going to be drawing a frame work for every problem you're going to solve. Now with that said, let's look at a very simple framework that helps you start to connect the final dots between how all of this works together. Now, sometimes, we'll have a big picture framework, starting at the top of the objectives, followed by KPIs, and then metrics. So the top, we might substitute our smart goal for a fairly big picture objective. Let's say we've set a broad goal to simply create social media awareness. Below this, we use our KPIs to summarize how well we are doing relative to those objectives. Ultimately, this is the measurable and specific piece of a smart goal but broken out for added clarity. So we want to create awareness on social media. Then we might need to set our KPIs to measure against something, and that could be reached in traffic. Then we need to tie metrics to these. These are the data points that inform our KPIs. So we'll need to measure impressions, engagements, and say unique visits. Now, ultimately, this is really just a way to help plan for what data you're collecting and what you're measuring against. I simply want you to always be thinking about the layered approach and how this all stacks together. Whether you have one objective or a dozen, or you use smart goals or broad goals combined with KPIs, all the elements are the same and there's always a framework behind them.


"
Metrics by Channel,"As we think through your marketing channels, you'll likely hear me referring to a channel that is either paid, earned, or owned. Now, these are fairly common terms used in the day-to-day of marketing. So let's take a minute to make sure we're on the same page. Your paid media will make up everything that you, well, pay for. This includes channels like newspaper ads, radio spots, Facebook ads, and direct mailing. Your owned media is everything that includes your website, your list of customers that you use to send out your emails, or even a blog that has an active readership. Earned media is the world of organic press. Word-of-mouth marketing, mentions on other blogs, and news articles written about you all make up channels within earned media. Now, you might be asking yourself, ""What about social media?"" Well, social media actually can live within all three. Social media could be a channel that you buy ads on paid, it could be a channel by which you own the property and send messages out, or it could be an area by which you're earning mentions on other people's social handles such as someone posting a tweet about you. Now, all of these channels will overlap, just as they overlap with social media. These make up the foundation of marketing. Let's talk about owned media. I think it's really easy to start here because this is really primarily your own website. Here, you're tracking how many visitors, where they're coming from, what pages they're visiting, how long they've stayed, and even what page they left from. When you look at your owned analytics, you get a sense of how users are finding your site, if they found what they want, if you're advertising objectives or driving a meaningful amount of traffic, and even whether your product or service is meeting the goals of your customers. With a resource like Google Analytics, you install a tracking code and from there, you have that goldmine of data to leverage segment and correlate. For example, let's say you make a change to your website and you notice on that day web traffic drops dramatically. Well, now you have a sense of where to start looking for that problem. If you rolled out a new landing page, you might see an increase in conversions resulting from that specific page, or perhaps you see a sudden spike in traffic. By drilling into that, you can identify the source such as a social media post or a mention on an online blog. Now, let's take a look at paid data. When you run online paid advertisements, you'll find that the platform you use is typically tied to several reports. This data is extremely useful as it can give you granular details on which ads are working, what targeting makes sense, and more. If you're paying for ads in print or sponsorship within your local community, you might have to leverage unique ways to capture data. This could involve a landing page with a custom URL or even accustomed phone number. Oftentimes, you'll have to attach records from various sources in order to understand what's happening with those particular campaigns. If you run a promotion, you might, for example, keep track of the amount of coupons that come through the door. Now, it's harder when you move into broadcast media to really measure the impact. For that, you often have to really start to correlate trends and changes. Oftentimes, it's better to work with the agency that's running your TV or radio spots to really get into the nitty gritty of analyzing that data. Now, the final part comes from earned media. This one is typically the most difficult. Here, your outcomes aren't necessarily determined by spend but how interesting people think your product and services are. Here, you're tracking things like your social media fanbase, how many mentions you have in articles or your share of voice. You may have many dashboards that you collect this data in and you'll want to look at it alongside all of your other advertising metrics. The best way to measure results with earned media is to have your own goals and objectives that you are comparing that data to. So for example, you decide that a mention in a magazine would increase your revenue potential by a $1,000. Well, now you can track how you're trending towards that goal and the effort you're investing. Remember, we're always trying to layer this data towards that objective, so we remember what metrics we need to get us there. Now, there's an endless amount of data providers out there as we saw, so investigate them against your needs and keep a system in place that provides you with the necessary checks and balances."
First Recap,"Let's take a minute to review everything we've covered. We started by talking about the ecosystem. We saw all of the tools and data sources that we can gather insights from. We also talked about how this data arrives from first party, second party to third party. Then, we looked at how we layer this data. We talked a little bit out an example of a grocery store, and how we start thinking about questions and framing our problems. Then, we looked at a process by which to really review this data: measure, analyze, and improve. From there, we looked at how to dive deeper into the analyzed piece of that analytics process by looking at metrics, so they're accurate and compared, and thinking of compared as change versus context. Next, we talked about five questions to answer in every analytics project. What happened? Were the results good? Why did it happen? What's happening now, and what's ahead in the future? From there, we looked at common questions and common metrics for a variety of situations. From there, we looked at business goals, especially how to create smart ones. Then, we looked at how to establish frameworks to take those goals and make them actionable with metrics. Finally, we reviewed paid, earned, and owned, and all of the type of metrics that fit into those channels. So I know what you might be thinking. This is a lot of information. But soon enough, we're going to start applying this information which will help to reinforce the concept we've learned. As you move further through this course, you can always come back and revisit these concepts to see how they apply to what we're going to be doing later.
"
Experiment,"Up until this point, we've looked at analytics as a way to answer questions that we have. We framed the question and then we use analytics to identify the answer. But there's another way that we can look at marketing analytics, and that's through the experiments that we run. Let's take AB testing for example. This is something that we will do often as marketers. Perhaps I want to evaluate whether a call to action makes more sense on the left side of the page or on the right side of the page. I would set up a test, I would measure the results, and I would identify the outcome. From there, I can take action. If the button on the left side performed better, then I would know that it wins and we would replace whatever we had on the page with that winning option. We would use our analytics to identify that outcome. You may also be working off a growth model such as high tempo testing. In this type of growth, you're coming up with a series of ideas, putting them into test, and identifying which ones win. Again, you're setting an outcome that you hope to happen and you're measuring on whether that outcome did happen, or what the outcome actually was. So we can either ask questions and look for answers, or we can develop a hypothesis to start our research project. Now, a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for how two variables are related. For example, I could hypothesize that changing that call to action improves conversions on my website. Now, when it comes to hypothesis, you should never phrase it as a question. It should be written as a statement that can be rejected or confirmed. We create and design tests. Now, we can figure out the metrics that are necessary to identify whether a hypothesis comes true.
"
Actions,"With every analytics project or analytics endeavor, we must report on our data. Now, we've touched on the importance of always having an action for our metrics. But let's talk deeper on how we distribute and share the actions that we want to take place. Within your marketing career, you're going to be tasked with building reports. Reports are how you share your findings, and socialize the recommendations. Essentially, you'll use reports to inform others of what action you hope to see happen. You're going to be framing the problem, and then proposing a solution or indicating that somebody needs to find that solution. So when it comes to building great reports, it's important that you keep things simple. Most of your analytics data would be presented as slides, and you should start by gathering the following information: your overview. What's the goal or the objectives that you're measuring against? This is essentially why you started this project. So you want to frame what's going on. Next is your hypothesis. What did you expect to happen? What was the desired outcome? Was your hypothesis true or false? From there, it's important to explain the methodology. How much data was collected, and where was that data collected? You're trying to help everyone understand that your findings are accurate. From here, well, the actual data. These are the metrics that you measured, and the graphs and charts that go with them. Finally, your recommendations. What should happen now that someone has seen this data? Typically, you keep this to three to five tactics. Things that are immediately executable. They can include your social media tactics, or any other communications based on those findings. Finally, at the end of your presentation, you can include everything else. This is your backup research, any findings you've had, or all of the additional information that you believe adds additional context to the conversation. It's there just in case the conversation warrants it. Now, as you sit down to create your report, you want to think about who's reading it. While we talked about the foundations, you'll ultimately customize this to the audience that you're presenting this information to. You may need to add more information, or remove it. Simply use that foundation as a starting point. But let's talk about how we can adapt these reports depending on who typically receives them. Now when it comes to sharing your data, it's usually either going to go to somebody who's in an executive position, or somebody who's in a management position, or perhaps to an analyst for further review. Executives like everything short. They're hoping to see a very small amount of data. They don't have time for the whole picture. Management is really looking at how they take action. They'd like to see a bigger picture, so they can understand whether or not the actions make sense. The analyst, well, they want all of the data. They're hoping to help understand and reframe the problem in a way that arrives at action. Let's talk a little bit more about the executives. Here's some information that you can include. First, your project scope. You want to remind them what you are working on. Not every executive is going to know about every objective that's going on in the company. So you want to frame the problem around that project scope. Who started it, who was working on it, and what was the outcome, or where were you headed? Now, this is really going to be your overview and hypotheses slides mixed together, including those details on that team leadership. Next, talk about the key data points. Again, keep it simple. Most executives don't care about all of the data that you have. Now, when it comes to your methodology, this is typically less important. You're really focusing on showing those findings. We saw this happen, and it happened because of these events. Now, it's important that you still include those key recommendations. Again, everything is actionable. So have ideas on what can be done with this information. Also, you can frame this in the context of, why are you sharing this information? Why are you presenting it? What takeaways are going to be important there? Now when it comes to preparing a presentation for a management, things are roughly the same, but there's a few changes. We also want to talk about the project's scope. These would be the tools that you use to collect the data, the date ranges that are used to find these results, and the volume of data that you collected. This is because someone in management is likely going to want to make sure that they agree with how you arrived at this conclusion. Now, you'll still include your key data points, because everyone's going to be interested in, what are the summary of those findings? Again, what did you measure, and why? Finally, it's okay to include note-worthy data. You might exclude elements from the executive report to prevent it from being too long. But with management, you'll want to include that information. As always, you're going to include those recommendations. You may have thoughts and ideas, even if you're not sure how to solve the problem. Now when it comes to analysts, they're going to care about everything the managers care about, plus all of your raw data. This is the time to overshare. That raw data might lead to additional research projects, or ways that that data can be refined. They're going to be incredibly curious about how you arrived at these findings, and they'll want to walk through in detail, the methodology on how you got there. Now remember, part of action is also communicating what needs to happen. These reports give you a valuable way to frame your thoughts, but do so in a way that keeps it simple, while still demonstrating that you've evaluated it in depth. You want to make sure that you never assume that everyone knows all the metrics and what you've collected, but you also don't want to burden them with all of the details. Create plenty of opportunities, so that the people that you're presenting to can ask questions or probe for more, if they're skeptical.
"
Practice,"The marketing analytics that we do and report on, provides direction for the entire company. So you'll want to be confident when it comes time to put this into practice. Now, confidence is going to come from experience and practice, but also in knowing that you're approaching things the right way. So let's talk about ways that marketing analytics projects come about, how you'll likely get involved early on in your career or with a new business, and how we can approach it. Because when you step into a role in marketing, you'll be putting your analytic skills into practice immediately. So the first thing that we can do if you're new to a team, is ask lots of questions. Questions don't have to come across as you being unskilled or under experienced, but instead they actually demonstrate confidence. You're making sure that you're approaching things properly and gaining clarity, and you'll gain a lot of respect for doing so. When you jump into a team or a new project, don't assume the vision is clear, don't assume the data is accurate, and don't assume that you have the full picture. When you're new to something, that is your opportunity to gain clarity, and you'll do that by asking questions. Now, you're slowly becoming more and more armed with taking on individual analytics projects and honing your skills on research and how to use that data. But there are a few points here to help you be more successful at that. For starters, you need to recognize your bias. When we work on something, we often want a particular outcome. We've worked really hard and we've invested a lot of our time, and so it's very easy to have a bias and start to twist the data to tell a version of the story or events that we want. You got to stop. It's really important to tell the real story. Again, big decisions are going to be made on this data and it'll fall apart if the data is inaccurate. Another piece as you're starting out is to not be surprised by metrics. If you act surprised that you're expected to pull a report or run an analysis, you'll look out of place. Think ahead and begin to be prepared for the fact that you will be asked to participate in an analytics project. Again, you can always ask for clarity. Now another really great thing to do when you're new to a team or a project is to practice socializing your findings. As you're looking at data and gaining deeper insights about what's going on, start talking to other people on your team about it. You'll find that they'll add in additional insights that help you build that layer of history that you need to be better at connecting those dots. Now, you'll find that projects and analytics range from small to large. So you'll want to get in the habit of having good practices so that you're more efficient as they come about. Let's switch gears, I want to talk about how this starts to show up in your day-to-day. For starters, analytics is not an extracurricular activity. It shouldn't be something you do when you have time. It needs to be baked into your routine. As you start your day, you're going to want to be looking at your most important metrics. You're going to be expected to know these. When I'm working with my marketing team, I often ask them randomly how their campaign is performing, how sales are doing, how a particular email did, and they're expected to know that answer. You don't want to be caught off guard. It's really easy to get locked in the idea that you're going to be reporting on these findings in a formal manner, at a particular meeting, or maybe after a campaign ends. But really, you need to be in that data often as informal conversations come up all the time. Now later, I'll guide you through what data that you'll want to be tracking at a minimum, but for now focus on owning that data. If there's a problem collecting the data, make it known that you've lost visibility. Take time to go into deeper insights or delegate them. You don't want to wait to let problems creep in, and that's why we set a cadence for review. Think about those daily metrics and then what metrics you might need to be looking at on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly basis. It's also important that you're anticipating the questions that might be asked and starting to prepare those reports early. You can even build out templates so that you're dropping in the data as you have it. Now, how you're involved in analytics is going to vary from job to job. You will be involved, so start planning ahead."
Values,"I want to leave you with something that I hope you'll find valuable as you start out in your marketing analytics endeavors. Jerry Rackley is a marketing author and executive and he created 10 values that I find incredibly useful in guiding any new initiative or on your journey as a marketing analyst. Let me paraphrase them for you. Every marketing initiative will begin with your success metrics. What is the objective? What are you measuring, and how do we qualify if we've been successful? Don't use or report metrics that are based on inaccurate or incomplete data. Don't use vanity metrics just to look busy or because someone likes to see marketing numbers. Now everyone will have an opinion, but metrics are the judge of the results or the success. When the analytics output conflicts with your beliefs, always choose the analytics. When the analytics reveal good results, take credit. When the analytics reveal poor results, take responsibility. Now don't use the output of the analytics process punitively. Only use it to improve. Analytics don't make the decisions. They inform the decisions that we ultimately make. Now, every marketing initiative will end by reviewing the data. I encourage you to follow these principles as you work on your own initiatives."
Recap,"In this lesson, we've learned how massive the analytics ecosystem is, and how that ecosystem collects and distributes data. We learned how to layer data together to answer our marketing questions, and we studied the foundations of how the analytics process works, how to analyze our metrics, and the questions we need to answer on every project. We reviewed the most common types of metrics that are available to us and how those metrics are measured. We also studied business goals and how important they are for guiding us on our analytics projects. We reviewed how and why we think actionably, how our day-to-day using marketing analytics will look and the values we should follow as we pursue new initiatives. The analytics we use to measure our marketing is undoubtably complex, but you've gained a valuable foundation that we will continue to build on to further your skills and confidence in analytics."
